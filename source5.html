            <h4>Energy Savings:
A very natural question you may ask yourself is- “does a pedestal fan even consume an amount of energy that <br>
I should be bothered about?” Well, yes it does. So much so, that if you get a good energy-saving fan that you’ll be using round the year,<br>
 you’d end up saving around 50% on your electricity bills!
Remote Control:
As mentioned above, pedestal fans are not far behind ceiling fans when it comes to innovation. <br>
Today, you can find a pedestal fan that comes with a remote control with functions like speed control,<br>
 oscillation control and timer control.
Light Weight:
Think about it, you would want to buy a pedestal fan because you don’t want to fix it in a particular spot, right?<br>
 It is safe to assume that you will use it in different areas in your home. Though not daily but regularly</h4>
